## To All the Piyadons Out There
If your name is "Piyadon" and you're mad at us for using this name, please take a deep breath and read this:

1. **Why "Piyadon"?**
   The name "Piyadon" was chosen for its uniqueness and cultural significance. It is not meant to refer to any specific individual. In fact, "Piyadon" can mean many things:
   - A company: https://www.dataforthai.com/company/0105520014832/
   - A common Thai name: https://www.mongkolname.com/?name=%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%8C+%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B9%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%9C%E0%B8%B9%E0%B9%89%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%9B%E0%B9%87%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B5%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%81

   If you believe this name somehow refers to you specifically, rest assured: it doesn‚Äôt. We simply thought it sounded cool!
